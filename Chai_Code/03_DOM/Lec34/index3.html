        // this is the inital though process to add a language as it common approach but it has a critical problem not in implementation but in functionality and practicality which is the appending requies the traversal of the the DOM again and again each time a new element is being added and if we have a few elements then it is of no problem but as the number of the elements grows, the performance can degrade significantly. To address this, we can use a more optimized approach.

        // this is a better approach because it minimizes the number of times we access the DOM, which can be a costly operation. By creating the li element and setting its text content all in one go, we reduce the performance overhead associated with multiple DOM manipulations.
