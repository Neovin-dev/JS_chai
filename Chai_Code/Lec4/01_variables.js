// LET, CONST, VAR KI KAHANI


// what is the motive of learning JS ?  to Build Web Apps. have the right mindset
// do investigative learning 

// console is used for printing the output
console.log("Hello World");

// camelcasing is good
const accountId = 12345;
// const
let accountEmail = "7M9Y8@example.com";
// let is better than var as it is block scoped
var accountPassword = "123456";
// var creates problem due to hoisting so it can be seen in old JS code but we prefer not to use it now. 

accountCity = "Delhi";
// we can reserve memory in js without using any keyword like the variable accountCity

let accountState; // undefined is the default value
// it is initialized but not declared in the memory

accountEmail = "7M9Y8@exafdfdgsdgasdfmple.com";
accountCity = "Pune";

console.log(accountId);
// JS initially doesnt used to work on scope of the variable. that can be seen in var
// so we mostly use let and const
/*
*/

console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState]);
